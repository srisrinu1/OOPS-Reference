<h2>Procedural Programming </h2>
<p>If you’re here, you’re probably familiar with the basics of programming already and have used methods in
 your programs at some point.Procedural programming is one programming paradigm among many.In procedural programming, a program is 
 divided into smaller parts called methods. These methods are the basic entities used to construct a program. One of the main advantages
 of procedural programming is code reusability. However, the implementation of a complex real-world scenario becomes a difficult task 
  unwieldy.</p>
 <h2>Object-Oriented Programming </h2> 
 <p><code>Object-oriented programming, also referred to as <b>OOP</b>, is a programming paradigm that includes, or relies, on the concept of classes and objects.</code></p>
<p></p>The basic entities in object-oriented programming are classes and objects.
Programming isn’t much use if you can’t model real-world scenarios using code, right? 
This is where Object-Oriented Programming comes into play.</p>
<p><code>The basic idea of OOP is to divide a sophisticated program into a bunch of objects talking to each other.</code>
Objects in a program frequently represent real-world objects.</p>

<p>Many other objects serve application logic and have no direct, real-world parallels. They manage things like authentication, templating, request handling, or any of the other myriad features needed for a practical application.</p>    
<h2>Anatomy of Objects and Classes #</h2>
<p>Objects may contain data in the form of fields (variables) and methods to operate on that data.</p>
<p>Think about the real-world objects around you. What are the characteristics of these objects? Take the example of a light bulb. It has a <b>state</b>, i.e., either it is on or off. It also has a <b>behavior</b>, i.e., when you turn it on it lights up, and when turned off, it stops spreading light. To conclude this, one can say:</p>
<code>Objects are a collection of data and their behaviors.</code>
<p>Interesting! Isn’t it? But the question is “where do these objects come from?”

Well, the answer to the above question is classes.</p>
<code>A Class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects.</code>
<p>The below illustration shows what a <b>LightBulb</b> class should look like:</p>

<p>From the above illustration, you can see that the state of the object is generally modeled using variables in a class, and the behavior is modeled using methods.</p>

<p>There can be many different objects of the same class. Each can be in an independent state, but they all share the same behavior and characteristics.</p>
